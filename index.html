                <p>What excites me about being part of this organization is that the work we do is not abstract. It directly supports care delivery, access to critical supplies, and ultimately patient outcomes.</p>
                <p>AI in this environment is not about technology for its own sake. It is about making the system more responsive, more intelligent, and more reliable, so clinicians, caregivers, and patients can trust the infrastructure behind them.</p>
                <p>This is an opportunity that is much bigger than any one individual. It connects to a purpose larger than ourselves. That purpose is being essential to care. When we build AI capability thoughtfully and responsibly, we are not just improving efficiency, we are strengthening the backbone of healthcare delivery.</p>
                <p><strong>That is a mission worth building around.</strong></p>

                <summary>Epic — Why This Experience Maps Directly to Cardinal</summary>
                <div class="ref-panel-body">
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">One of the most defining experiences in my career was partnering closely with Epic as they moved from early experimentation to scaling enterprise-grade AI across their healthcare ecosystem. My role was to help shape the platform, governance, and operating model required to take AI safely into production in highly regulated clinical environments.</p>
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">We worked across Epic, major health systems, and clinical leadership to prioritize high-impact use cases, embed responsible AI and governance by design, and operationalize AI into real workflows, not pilots. Today, those capabilities are deployed across hundreds of healthcare organizations, used by millions of users, and generating measurable clinical, operational, and financial impact.</p>
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0;">What excites me about this role is the translation is direct. Cardinal is at a similar inflection point — moving from fragmented AI efforts to enterprise-scale capability. I've already helped build that playbook in regulated healthcare, and I know how to accelerate it here while managing risk and delivering measurable value.</p>

                <summary>Top 10 Generative AI Use Cases for Epic</summary>
                <div class="ref-panel-body">
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Ambient Documentation &amp; AI Charting:</strong> Using the Art for Clinicians tool, Epic ambiently listens to patient-provider conversations to draft real-time progress notes and clinical summaries. Early adopters have reported saving 34 minutes per day on notes, significantly reducing &ldquo;pajama time&rdquo;.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clinical Copilots &amp; Smart Ordering:</strong> As a virtual assistant, AI identifies orders discussed during a visit (labs, meds, imaging) and queues them for the clinician to verify and sign with a single click.</li>
                        <li><strong>Administrative Overhead &amp; Prior Authorization:</strong> AI drafts responses to insurance denial appeals and pre-populates prior authorization requests based on chart data, completing these tasks up to 23% faster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Patient-Facing AI (Emmie):</strong> Integrated into MyChart, the assistant Emmie provides conversational support for scheduling, explaining complex medical bills, and setting up payment plans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automated Patient Messaging:</strong> AI drafts empathetic, plain-language responses to patient portal messages, pulling in relevant lab results and medications to ensure accuracy before physician review.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Visit Preparation &amp; Chart Summarization:</strong> The &ldquo;Insights&rdquo; feature analyzes voluminous patient history to create concise, context-specific summaries (e.g., &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happened since the last visit&rdquo;) to help providers prepare in seconds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nursing Efficiency &amp; Shift Handoffs:</strong> Specific AI tools for nurses draft end-of-shift notes and flowsheet documentation, helping the next shift get up to speed quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advancing Medicine via Cosmos:</strong> By leveraging Epic Cosmos (data from 280M+ patients), AI provides diagnostic insights by identifying &ldquo;look-alike&rdquo; patients and comparing recovery trajectories to population norms.</li>

                <summary>Biggest Leadership Challenge — Epic + UC/UT Systems</summary>
                <div class="ref-panel-body">
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">One of the toughest leadership moments came when we were scaling AI with Epic across large health systems like the UC and UT networks. The challenge was not technology. It was alignment and trust. We had multiple stakeholders — Epic product leadership, clinical leaders, compliance, and large healthcare providers — each with different risk tolerance, priorities, and pace. At the same time, expectations around AI were high, but governance and operational readiness were still evolving.</p>
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">The turning point was shifting from a technology rollout to a trust-first operating model. I helped establish clear use-case prioritization, risk-tiered governance, and human-in-the-loop safeguards for high-impact workflows. We aligned clinical, technology, and executive stakeholders around measurable outcomes — reducing clinician burden, improving decision support, and maintaining strict regulatory and patient-safety standards.</p>
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0;">Once trust was established, adoption accelerated across multiple health systems. That experience shaped how I lead large-scale AI transformation today — alignment first, governance by design, and disciplined execution at enterprise scale.</p>

            <blockquote>
                At McKesson, I inherited a landscape where AI existed in pockets — fragmented, ungoverned, and disconnected from business outcomes. The mandate was to turn that into structured enterprise AI capability. I started by aligning executive leadership around a shared vision, then stood up a hub-and-spoke CoE with governance by design. Within 6 months, we had 3 high-value supply chain use cases in production, a governance framework adopted across the enterprise, and a clear pipeline of next initiatives — all with measurable margin impact.<br><br>
                The hardest part wasn't the technology — it was shifting the organizational mindset from "AI is a tech project" to "AI is a business capability." That required persistent executive alignment, visible wins, and building trust through governance. Transformation is a marathon, but you need sprint-speed early wins to keep momentum.

                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 14px;">We established an <strong>AI governance council</strong> spanning clinical, legal, security, and technology to tier models by risk and enforce controls such as human-in-the-loop for high-impact workflows, bias and validation testing, and full data lineage for auditability.</p>
                    <p style="color:#c9d1d9; font-size:0.82rem; line-height:1.7; margin:0 0 18px;">Governance was embedded directly into our <strong>MLOps pipeline</strong>, including drift monitoring and post-deployment performance tracking. This allowed us to scale AI safely into production across multiple health systems while maintaining regulatory compliance and clinical trust.</p>

                <li>At scale, successful AI adoption requires far more than models and tooling — it depends on <strong>robust data foundations</strong> (trusted, governed, and well-modeled data), <strong>clear governance and security controls</strong>, and <strong>disciplined change management</strong> to drive sustained adoption</li>
                <li>We need platforms with AI capabilities that are <strong>integrated into production workflows</strong> — grounded in strong data pipelines and measured against <strong>explicit business KPIs</strong> — so we can shift from point capabilities to <strong>systemic enablers of enterprise impact</strong></li>

                <li><em>"I never start with technology. I start with <strong>business value, risk, and competitive positioning</strong>. Each leader sees AI through a different lens — financial impact for the CFO, platform and governance for the CIO, innovation and velocity for the CTO, and enterprise competitiveness for the CEO and Board. My role is translating AI into what matters for each of them, building multi-threaded alignment, and using tangible outcomes to create conviction. When leaders see AI as a <strong>strategic capability rather than a technology initiative</strong>, buy-in becomes natural. I've led this shift multiple times, and the <strong>pattern is very consistent</strong>."</em></li>

            <h3 class="section-label">Adoption Metrics & Operationalization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active usage</strong> — daily/weekly active users, session frequency, feature utilization depth</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow integration</strong> — is AI embedded in the actual business process or sitting as a side tool? Embedded = real adoption</li>
                <li><strong>User satisfaction & trust</strong> — NPS, CSAT, qualitative feedback from end users; if users don't trust the output, adoption stalls</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior change</strong> — are teams actually changing how they work? Track process adherence, decision path changes, manual override rates</li>
                <li><strong>Self-service growth</strong> — are business teams requesting and extending AI capabilities on their own? A sign of true organizational adoption</li>
                <li><strong>Training & enablement reach</strong> — % of workforce trained on AI tools, completion rates, competency improvement over time</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">How to Measure AI Success & Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business value delivered</strong> — revenue generated, cost reduced, margin improved, cycle time shortened — tie every AI initiative to a quantifiable business outcome</li>
                <li><strong>Adoption rate</strong> — % of target users actively using AI-powered tools/workflows weekly; if adoption is low, the solution hasn't solved the right problem or the change management failed</li>
                <li><strong>Time-to-value</strong> — how fast from ideation → production → measurable impact; goal is to compress this continuously as the platform matures</li>
                <li><strong>Decision quality improvement</strong> — are decisions faster, more accurate, more consistent? Measure before/after on key workflows (e.g., forecasting accuracy, error rates, approval turnaround)</li>
                <li><strong>Operational efficiency</strong> — FTE hours saved, manual steps eliminated, throughput increase, SLA improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Model performance</strong> — accuracy, precision, recall, drift monitoring — but always connected to business KPIs, not just technical metrics in isolation</li>
                <li><strong>Reusability & platform leverage</strong> — how many use cases run on shared platform vs. bespoke builds; measures maturity of the AI factory model</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">Pilot → Production → Enterprise</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scale what works</strong> — don't try to scale everything, double down on proven use cases</li>
                <li>Most organizations are <strong>stuck in POC mode</strong> — the real work starts at production</li>
                <li>Enterprise scale requires: <strong>platform, standards, repeatable patterns</strong></li>
                <li>Build a <strong>deployment playbook</strong> — every model follows the same production path</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">How to Identify AI Failure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low or declining usage</strong> — deployed but not used; the #1 failure signal</li>
                <li><strong>No measurable business impact</strong> — technically functional but not moving any business KPI</li>
                <li><strong>High override rate</strong> — users consistently ignoring or overriding AI recommendations signals a trust or accuracy problem</li>
                <li><strong>Stuck in POC</strong> — initiative never reaches production; common when there's no platform, no governance, or no executive sponsorship</li>
                <li><strong>Model drift without detection</strong> — performance degrades over time with no monitoring; operational risk</li>
                <li><strong>Orphaned models</strong> — models in production with no owner, no monitoring, no update cadence</li>
                <li><strong>Escalating cost without proportional value</strong> — infrastructure and operational costs growing faster than business value delivered</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">Measurement Framework I Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Four-layer measurement</strong>: (1) Technical health — model performance, latency, drift | (2) Product health — usage, adoption, satisfaction | (3) Business impact — revenue, cost, margin, cycle time | (4) Organizational maturity — reusability, self-service, AI fluency</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly AI value review</strong> — dashboard-driven, not slide decks; every initiative reports on adoption + business value + operational health</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly portfolio review</strong> — kill, scale, or pivot decisions based on data; no zombie projects</li>
                <li><strong>Leading vs. lagging indicators</strong> — track early signals (usage trends, user feedback) alongside outcome metrics (revenue, efficiency); don't wait 6 months to learn something failed</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">Sustained Value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustained value, not one-time wins</strong> — adoption must be durable, not a campaign</li>
                <li>Continuously reinforce through <strong>feedback loops, retraining, and optimization</strong></li>
                <li>Success metric shifts from <strong>"does it work?" to "does it deliver value at scale?"</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask: "How do you measure AI success and adoption?"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I measure on <strong>four layers</strong>: technical health (is the model performing?), product health (are people using it?), business impact (is it moving a KPI?), and organizational maturity (is the capability scaling?). Most teams only measure the first layer — model accuracy — and declare success. But if nobody's using it or it's not driving a business outcome, it's not a success. At Microsoft, we tracked active usage weekly and tied every AI feature to a revenue or efficiency metric. If usage dropped, we treated it as a product problem and fixed it — not a data science issue.</li>
                <li>On the failure side, I look for <strong>three early warning signs</strong>: declining usage, high override rates, and initiatives stuck in POC. I run a monthly value review — dashboard-driven, no slide decks — where every initiative reports adoption, business value, and operational health. Quarterly, we make kill/scale/pivot decisions based on data. No zombie projects. The discipline of measuring and acting on measurement is what separates organizations that scale AI from those that just experiment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask: "How do you move beyond pilots?"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most organizations get stuck in POC mode because they treat every AI initiative as a <strong>standalone project instead of a platform capability</strong>. The fix is building repeatable patterns — a deployment playbook, shared infrastructure, standard governance gates — so the second use case is 3x faster than the first. At UnitedHealthcare, introducing platform-based architecture reduced time-to-deploy by 60% after the first use case was live.</li>
                <li>The measurement shift is critical too. Most teams measure <strong>model deployment</strong> — did we ship it? The real metric is <strong>sustained usage and business impact</strong>. I track active users, decision quality improvement, and dollars of value delivered monthly. If usage drops, that's a product problem, not a data science problem — and we treat it that way.</li>

                <li><strong>Fine-tuning for behavioral adaptation</strong> — tone, domain-specific reasoning, specialized formats</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Cardinal Health has massive internal knowledge — supply chain procedures, regulatory documentation, product specifications, customer contracts. RAG lets us build <strong>copilots that answer questions grounded in that real data</strong>, not hallucinated responses from a general-purpose LLM. Imagine a planner asking "What's the reorder trigger for Product X at Distribution Center Y?" and getting an accurate, cited answer in seconds instead of searching three systems.</li>
                <li>The architecture is straightforward but the <strong>data pipeline discipline is critical</strong> — chunking strategy, embedding quality, refresh cadence, and access control. In a healthcare environment, you also need <strong>PII filtering and compliance-aware retrieval</strong> so sensitive data never leaks into a response. I've built these pipelines before — the key is treating RAG as enterprise infrastructure, not a demo.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Agents are most valuable where there are <strong>multi-step, repetitive workflows with clear decision logic</strong>. At Cardinal, think of order exception handling — an agent could automatically investigate a flagged order, check inventory, verify pricing rules, and either resolve it or escalate with a full context packet. That's hours of manual work compressed into minutes, with full audit trails.</li>
                <li>The critical point is <strong>control</strong>. Enterprise agents must operate within defined guardrails — scope limits, approval gates for high-value actions, and human-in-the-loop for anything touching patient safety or regulatory compliance. I would start with <strong>supervised agents in low-risk operational workflows</strong>, prove the pattern, then carefully expand autonomy as trust builds.</li>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Augmentation, not replacement</strong> — Copilot amplifies human capability, doesn't replace judgment</li>

            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask: "How would you deploy Copilot at Cardinal?"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Copilot adoption follows the same playbook as any enterprise AI — <strong>start with high-value personas, not a broad rollout</strong>. I'd identify 3–5 roles where Copilot delivers immediate productivity gains — supply chain planners summarizing exception reports, finance teams analyzing contracts, customer service generating grounded responses. Measure usage and value for 90 days, then expand based on data.</li>
                <li>The enterprise deployment model requires <strong>data hygiene first</strong> — Copilot is only as good as the data in SharePoint, Teams, and Microsoft Graph. I'd work with data governance to ensure content is organized, permissioned correctly, and free of stale or sensitive data before broad enablement. Security is non-negotiable — existing permissions carry through, so the <strong>permissioning model must be tight before Copilot amplifies access</strong>.</li>

            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask: "How would you design Cardinal's AI platform?"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'd design the platform in layers: <strong>data foundation → model services → application layer → governance → observability</strong>. The data foundation is most critical at Cardinal — supply chain, clinical, and financial data needs to be unified, governed, and AI-ready. On top of that, shared model services (inference APIs, embedding pipelines, prompt management) so every business unit builds on the same substrate instead of creating silos.</li>
                <li>Given Cardinal's GCP footprint, I'd leverage <strong>Vertex AI and BigQuery as the backbone</strong>, with flexibility for Azure OpenAI or other model providers where needed. The platform team's job is making it <strong>easy for domain teams to build, deploy, and monitor AI</strong> — self-service with guardrails. The ROI of a platform is exponential: the first use case might cost X, but the tenth costs X/10 because the infrastructure, patterns, and governance are already in place.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Production AI requires the <strong>same operational rigor as any mission-critical system</strong>. Every model has an owner, a monitoring dashboard, defined SLAs, and automated alerting for drift, performance degradation, or cost anomalies. I implement champion-challenger frameworks so new model versions are validated against production baselines before they replace anything.</li>
                <li>In healthcare supply chain, <strong>reliability has patient safety implications</strong>. If a demand forecasting model drifts and causes a stockout of critical medications, that's not a technical problem — it's a patient impact problem. That's why I treat model lifecycle with the same discipline as software production systems: <strong>CI/CD, automated testing, rollback capability, and 24/7 monitoring</strong>.</li>

                The opportunity here isn't just to implement AI — it's to <strong>embed intelligence into the systems that healthcare depends on</strong>.<br><br>
                When we reduce friction in operations, when we anticipate demand, when we support decision-making with real-time insights, we directly <strong>improve reliability in care delivery</strong>.<br><br>
                That's bigger than technology. <strong>That's impact.</strong><br><br>
                And when a team understands that their work strengthens the infrastructure of healthcare itself, <strong>motivation becomes intrinsic</strong>.

            <ul>
                <li>Early in one engagement, I sponsored an ambitious enterprise AI initiative that tried to solve too many problems at once — <strong>demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and routing all in one deployment</strong>. The technology worked, but we overwhelmed the operational teams. Adoption was near zero because we didn't invest in change management, and the scope made it impossible to show clear, focused value. I learned that <strong>you have to earn the right to scale</strong> by delivering narrow, undeniable wins first.</li>
                <li>The course correction was decisive: <strong>scoped down to one use case, one persona, one measurable outcome</strong>. Delivered value in 60 days, built trust, then expanded. That lesson now shapes how I approach every new initiative — start narrow, prove value, then scale with confidence. Governance was also weak in that first attempt, which is why I now build it in from day one.</li>

                <p>The hardest decisions are usually people-related. In one situation, a strong contributor became misaligned with the direction and execution pace required. I focused first on clarity, support, and alignment, but when it became clear the role and expectations no longer matched, I made a respectful transition. It was difficult, but it restored team clarity and execution. Leadership often requires balancing empathy with responsibility.</p>

                <div class="response-label">Full Response</div>
                <p>One of the hardest leadership decisions I've had to make was addressing a situation where a respected and capable leader on my team was no longer aligned with the direction the organization needed to go.</p>
                <p>The individual had strong technical credibility and had contributed meaningfully in earlier phases, but as we moved from experimentation into scaled execution, the role required a different level of cross-functional collaboration, pace, and accountability. Over time, the misalignment began impacting team cohesion and execution momentum.</p>
                <p>Before making any decision, I focused on clarity and fairness. I had direct, transparent conversations to understand whether this was a capability gap, an alignment gap, or something else. I provided clear expectations, support, and time to adjust, because my responsibility as a leader is first to enable success, not rush to judgment.</p>
                <p>Despite those efforts, it became clear that continuing in the same structure would not be in the best interest of the team or the individual. I made the decision to transition the role respectfully and thoughtfully, ensuring the individual was treated with dignity and supported through the change.</p>
                <p>It was difficult because leadership decisions often affect people, not just outcomes. But the result was that the team regained clarity, alignment improved, and execution strengthened significantly.</p>
                <p>The lesson reinforced for me was that leadership requires balancing empathy with responsibility — making fair, transparent decisions that support both people and the long-term health of the organization.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I was leading an AI initiative where we'd invested significant resources into a vendor-built solution that wasn't delivering. The team was emotionally invested, the vendor relationship was important to the org, and sunk cost was real. I made the decision to <strong>sunset the vendor approach and rebuild on our own platform</strong> — it was unpopular in the short term, but within 6 months our internal solution was outperforming at a fraction of the cost. The key was <strong>presenting the data transparently</strong>, acknowledging the team's effort, and framing it as a strategic pivot, not a failure.</li>
                <li>I've learned that the best leaders <strong>make hard calls early and communicate them clearly</strong>. Waiting for perfect information means the decision makes itself — usually badly. I document my reasoning, seek diverse input before deciding, and then commit fully. People don't need perfect decisions — they need <strong>clear decisions with clear rationale</strong>.</li>

                <li>Each pillar must be <strong>intentionally designed and governed</strong> to deliver enterprise-scale outcomes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-label">1. Business Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AI investments must be <strong>anchored to business priorities</strong> — revenue, cost, risk, experience</li>
                <li>Every AI initiative starts with a <strong>business case, not a model</strong></li>
                <li>Business strategy defines <strong>where AI creates value</strong> — supply chain optimization, demand forecasting, cost-to-serve reduction</li>
                <li>AI roadmap should be a <strong>subset of the enterprise strategy</strong>, not a parallel track</li>

            <h3 class="section-label">2. Technology Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Platform decisions drive <strong>scale, reuse, and speed</strong> — cloud, data infrastructure, MLOps, integration</li>
                <li>Build a <strong>composable AI platform</strong> — shared services, APIs, reusable pipelines</li>
                <li>Align with enterprise architecture — <strong>GCP/Vertex AI, data mesh, feature stores, CI/CD for ML</strong></li>
                <li>Technology strategy must support <strong>production-grade reliability</strong>, not just experimentation</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Governance is the <strong>foundation, not a constraint</strong> — it enables speed at scale</li>
                <li>Cover <strong>model risk, data lineage, bias, explainability, and compliance</strong> (SOX, HIPAA, FDA)</li>

            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>"How do these five pillars work together?"</em> — They are interdependent. Business strategy sets direction, technology strategy enables it, AI strategy and experience define how it's delivered, org and culture drive adoption, and governance ensures it scales responsibly. At Cardinal Health, I would align all five from day one — using the CoE as the integration point so nothing moves in isolation.</li>
                <li><em>"Which pillar is most often neglected?"</em> — Org and culture. Most enterprises invest in technology and governance but underinvest in fluency, change management, and the cultural shift required. At McKesson and Microsoft, some of the hardest work was getting supply chain operators and business leaders to trust AI-driven recommendations — that's a culture problem, not a tech problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-label">If They Ask: "How would you structure the CoE at Cardinal?"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'd start by <strong>assessing the current state</strong> — what exists, what's working, where the gaps are. Then I'd design a hub-and-spoke model where the central team owns platform, governance, and reusable capability, while business units own use case execution and value realization. The key is making the CoE a <strong>force multiplier, not a bottleneck</strong>. I'd begin with 2–3 lighthouse use cases in supply chain or operations, prove the model, then scale the pattern horizontally across the enterprise.</li>
                <li>The CoE also needs to be <strong>cross-functional from day one</strong> — data, engineering, governance, security, and business all at the table. At Cardinal, given the complexity of supply chain and regulatory requirements, governance has to be embedded from the start, not layered on later.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In healthcare, governance isn't optional — it's the <strong>license to operate</strong>. I treat governance as a day-one design requirement, not a compliance checkpoint. That means every model has a <strong>clear owner, a risk tier, documented lineage, and monitoring in place</strong> before it goes to production. I've done this at MD Anderson in a HIPAA-regulated environment and at McKesson where supply chain decisions directly impact patient safety.</li>
                <li>The key insight is that <strong>governance enables speed, not the opposite</strong>. When teams trust the guardrails, they move faster because they're not afraid of compliance surprises. I also ensure governance scales — lightweight for low-risk use cases, rigorous for anything touching clinical data, pricing, or patient-facing decisions.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I use a <strong>stage-gate approach</strong> — fund to the next proof point, not to completion. Every initiative needs a business sponsor, a measurable outcome, and a clear path to scale. If a pilot can't show value within a defined timeframe, we kill it and redeploy resources. At McKesson, I implemented quarterly portfolio reviews where every AI initiative was evaluated on business impact, adoption trajectory, and scalability — the result was fewer projects but more scaled impact.</li>
                <li>I also balance the portfolio between <strong>operational value (near-term ROI) and strategic bets (future capability)</strong>. Cardinal Health needs both — AI that protects margins today and AI that positions the company for competitive advantage tomorrow. The key is never letting innovation theater consume resources that should be driving enterprise value.</li>

                <div class="response-label">Full Response</div>
                <p>I've spent my career at the intersection of technology transformation and enterprise execution. Early in my career, I was deeply involved in large-scale data and ERP consolidation efforts, including working across complex ecosystems involving Oracle, SAP, and enterprise platforms.</p>
                <p>At Microsoft, I've had the opportunity to work alongside some of the largest healthcare providers, supply chain organizations, and healthcare technology firms. My role has focused on helping them operationalize AI — from executive strategy discussions through MVP design, governance, scaling, cost optimization, and broad rollout. Many of those initiatives are now customer-facing, revenue-generating solutions used by millions of end users.</p>
                <p>Over time, I've realized I'm most energized not just by shaping transformation, but by building durable enterprise capability inside one organization. That's why I'm pursuing this next step.</p>

                <p>The hardest decisions are usually people-related. In one situation, a strong contributor became misaligned with the direction and execution pace required. I focused first on clarity, support, and alignment, but when it became clear the role and expectations no longer matched, I made a respectful transition. It was difficult, but it restored team clarity and execution. Leadership often requires balancing empathy with responsibility.</p>

                <div class="response-label">Full Response</div>
                <p>One of the hardest leadership decisions I've had to make was addressing a situation where a respected and capable leader on my team was no longer aligned with the direction the organization needed to go.</p>
                <p>The individual had strong technical credibility and had contributed meaningfully in earlier phases, but as we moved from experimentation into scaled execution, the role required a different level of cross-functional collaboration, pace, and accountability. Over time, the misalignment began impacting team cohesion and execution momentum.</p>
                <p>Before making any decision, I focused on clarity and fairness. I had direct, transparent conversations to understand whether this was a capability gap, an alignment gap, or something else. I provided clear expectations, support, and time to adjust, because my responsibility as a leader is first to enable success, not rush to judgment.</p>
                <p>Despite those efforts, it became clear that continuing in the same structure would not be in the best interest of the team or the individual. I made the decision to transition the role respectfully and thoughtfully, ensuring the individual was treated with dignity and supported through the change.</p>
                <p>It was difficult because leadership decisions often affect people, not just outcomes. But the result was that the team regained clarity, alignment improved, and execution strengthened significantly.</p>
                <p>The lesson reinforced for me was that leadership requires balancing empathy with responsibility — making fair, transparent decisions that support both people and the long-term health of the organization.</p>
